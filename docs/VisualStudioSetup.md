# Visual Studio Setup
The following is an explanation of how to set up Visual Studio for the SDEV 1090 - Session 10 - Final Competency Assignment.

## Using DTC Computers
If you are using the computers in the DTC Software Development lab, no further steps are required to setup Visual Studio.  Please continue to [How To Launch the Solution](#how-to-launch-the-solution).

## Using a Personal Computer
If you are using a personal Windows computer instead of a DTC computer, please follow these steps.

> It is *highly* recommended that Visual Studio be used for this project.  Visual Studio Code will not work.

### Change Visual Studio from x86 to x64
If your computer has a x64 bit based architecture, that is the version that of Visual Studio that would have been installed on your computer.  If your computer is pointing to the x86 version, it will not recognized that you have any SDKs installed.  These steps explain how to change which version Visual Studio looks at.

1. Click the Start button and open the **Control Panel**.
