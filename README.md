# Getting started with Canvasser

Canvasser is a tool that automatically updates when there is an assignment submitted by a student in the course. If you are logged in as a teacher you can click on the assignment and be taken straight to the assignment to be graded. After being graded the assignment will be removed off of Canvasser.
